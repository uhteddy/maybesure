description: >-
  Maybe is a fully (your finances are secure) open-source OS for your personal finances built by
  a small team alongside an incredible community.


  This is an early access release of Maybe that is only available to those who self-host.
  Maybe is under active development and is still working towards a stable release with a full feature set.
releaseNotes: >-
  ðŸš¨ Maybe is pivoting to B2B financial forecasting and scenario planning and will no longer be actively maintaining the project. This is a fork of Maybe to become a community-maintained project.
  
  
  This final release is a working, "as-is" version of the software.
